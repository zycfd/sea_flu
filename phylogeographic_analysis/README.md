# Phylogeographic analyses

- **Step 1:** Phylogeographic analysis between Southeastern Asia and temperate regions
- **Step 2:** Phylogeographic analysis within Southeastern Asia
## Note
Before running the XML files a file of empirical posterior trees needs to be obtained and the filenames of the empirical tree files in the XML files may need to be modified. The empirical tree files in Step 1 can be obtained from the analyses inside `phylogenetic_analyses/` folder.
