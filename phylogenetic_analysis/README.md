# Phylogenetic analyses

## Note
Genetic sequences have been scrubbed from BEAST XML files because of GISAID [terms of use](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/terms-of-use/). Sequence identifiers are still included in the XML files and sequences can be downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) or [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/).
